His club document described him as a left-back. Hailing from a poor Catholic family,[12] Vinícius went to live in Abolição with his uncle, Ulisses, to shorten the distance to Ninho do Urubu (the Vultures' Nest). He started to receive financial aid from Flamengo as well as aid from entrepreneurs.[13] Between 2007 and 2010, Vinícius attended futsal classes at Flamengo's school in São Gonçalo at the Canto do Rio, a famous club located in the centre of Niterói.",
